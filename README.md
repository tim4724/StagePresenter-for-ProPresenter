# ![Icon](/icon64x64.png?raw=true) StagePresenter for ProPresenter

A better Stage Display for ProPresenter 7.
An electron application that automatically synchronizes with ProPresenter
and displays Presentations, Playlists, Slide-Previews, Timers, Countdowns and Stage-Messages.

StagePresenter can be used on the same machine, where ProPresenter is running.
It can also be installed on a different machine on the same network.

## Screenshots

All of the display will be used to show song lyrics.<br>
StagePresenter shows more than the current and next slide.<br>
If possible the complete verse, chorus or bridge is on the screen, since they get repeated quite often.
